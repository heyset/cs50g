# CS50x Games Repository

This repository contains the code for (almost) everything I'll be developing throughout the course [CS50' Introduction to Game Development](https://cs50.harvard.edu/games/2018/).

Each branch contains a project, since they all require being a flat structure in its own branch to be submitted.
